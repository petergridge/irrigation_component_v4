# Irrigation Component V4 <img src="https://github.com/petergridge/irrigation_component_v4/blob/main/icon.png" alt="drawing" width="75"/>

### Latest Changes V4.0.12
* Add inter zone delay to provide a delay between zones starting.
* Add zone grouping to allow groups of zones to run concurrently. 
* Requires Custom Card version 4.0.12
* Breaking change:
* DEPRECATED *icon* attributes
* DEPRECATED *allow_multiple* option as this is replaced by zone groups.

This release sees the delivery of a **custom card https://github.com/petergridge/irrigation_card** to render the program options specified in the configuration.

The driver for this project is to provide an easy to configure user interface for the gardener of the house. The goal is that once the inital configuration is done all the features can be modified using the custom lovelace card.

The provided working test harness is self contained with dummy switches and rain sensor that can be used to become familiar with the capabilities of the component.

**Image 1:** All attributes rendered using the companion custom card

All the inputs of the platform are Home Assistant entities for example the start time is provided via a input_datetime entity. The information is evaluated to trigger the irrigation action according to the inputs provided.

Watering can occur in an Eco mode where a water/wait/repeat cycle is run to minimise run off by letting water soak in using several short watering cycles. The wait and repeat configuration is optional.

The rain sensor is implemented as a binary_sensor, this allows practically any combination of sensors to suspend the irrigation. This can be defined at the zone level to allow for covered areas to continue watering while exposed areas are suspended.

Implemented as a switch, you can start a program manually or using an automation. Manually starting a program by turning the switch on will not evaluate the rain sensor rules it will just run the shedule, as there is an assumption that there is an intent to run the program.

Only one program can run at a time by default to prevent multiple solenoids being activated. If program start times result in an overlap the running program will be stopped.

## INSTALLATION

### To create a working sample
* Copy the custom_components/irrigationprogram folder to the ‘config/custom components/’ directory
* Restart Home Assistant
* Copy the 'irrigationtest.yaml' file to the packages directory or into configuration.yaml
* Restart Home Assistant
* Install irrigation_custom_card from this repository **https://github.com/petergridge/irrigation_card**
* Follow the custom card instructions to add a card for each of: switch.morning, switch.afternoon and switch.night

### Important
* Make sure that all of the objects you reference i.e. input_boolean, switch etc are defined or you will get errors when the irrigationprogram is triggered. Check the log for errors.

### Pre-requisite
* The time_date integration is required
```yaml
sensor:
  - platform: time_date
    display_options:
      - 'time'
      - 'date'
```
### Debug
Add the following to your logger section configuration.yaml
```yaml
logger:
    default: warning
    logs:
        custom_components.irrigationprogram: debug
```
### Rain Sensor feature
If a rain sensor is not defined the zone will always run at the nominated start time.

If the irrigation program is run manually the rain sensor value is ignored and all zones will run.

The rain sensor can be optionally defined in each zone. You can:
* Define the same sensor for each zone 
* Have a different sensor for different areas
* Configure the ability to ignore the rain sensor

### Time or Volume based watering
You can define a 'flow sensor' that provides a volume/minute rate. eg litres per minute. Once defied the 'water' attribute will be read as volume eg 15 litres not 15 minutes.

This example is for a zone that has been defined with a flow sensor
```yaml
zones:
  - zone: switch.zone_1
    name: Lawn
    water: input_number.irrigation_lawn_water
    flow_sensor: sensor.irrigation_flow_sensor
    zone_group: input_text.zone1_group
```

### Zone Group
You can optionally group zones to run concurrently or sequentially. Inputs are from an input_text or input_select helper defined for each zone. Blank groups are treated as sequential zones. Zones are grouped by having the same text value, for example each zone with a value of 'A' will run concurrently.

```
zones:
  - zone: switch.zone_1
    name: Lawn
    water: input_number.irrigation_lawn_water
    zone_group: input_text.zone1_group
```

### Monitor Controller feature
If this binary sensor is defined it will not execute a schedule if the controller is offline. This is ideal for ESP Home implementations.

### Watering Adjuster feature
As an alternative to the rain sensor you can also use the watering adjustment. With this feature the integrator is responsible to provide the value using a input_number component. I imagine that this would be based on weather data or a moisture sensor.

See the **https://github.com/petergridge/openweathremaphistory** for a companion custom comsensor that may be useful.

Setting *water_adjustment* attribute allows a factor to be applied to the watering time.

* If the factor is 0 no watering will occur
* If the factor is 0.5 watering will run for only half the configured watering time/volume. Wait and repeat attributes are unaffected.

The following automation is an example of how the input_number.adjust_run_time could be maintained
```yaml
automation:
- id: '1553507967550'
  alias: rain adjuster
  mode: restart
  trigger:
  - platform: time_pattern
    minutes: "/1"
  action:
    - service: input_number.set_value
      entity_id: input_number.rain_adjuster
      data:
        value: "{{ value template calculation }}"
```

### Run Days and Run Frequency
Run frequency allows the definition of when the program will run.

This can be a specific set of days or the number of days between watering events. This can be defined at the Program or zone level. Application at the zone level allows different zones to execute at the same time but using varying frquencies. for example: Vege Patch every two days and the Lawn once a week.

* *Run Freq* allows the water to occur at a specified frequency, for example, every 3 days or only on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday. 
* *Run Days DEPRECATED*  in this version, if you used this in version 3 simply rename *Run Days* to *Run Freq* to retain the same behaviour.

Defining a selection list to use with the run_freq attribute, remove the options you don't want to use.
```yaml
input_select:
  irrigation_freq:
    name: Zone1 Frequency
    options:
      - "1"
      - "2"
      - "3"
      - "4"
      - "5"
      - "6"
      - "7"
      - "['Wed','Sat']"
      - "['Sun','Thu']"
      - "['Mon','Fri']"
      - "['Tue','Sat']"
      - "['Sun','Wed']"
      - "['Mon','Thu']"
      - "['Tue','Fri']"
      - "['Mon','Wed','Fri']"
      - "['Mon','Tue','Wed','Thu','Fri','Sat','Sun']"
```

### ECO feature
The ECO feature allows multiple short watering cycles to be configure for a zone in the program to minimise run off and wastage. Setting the optional configuration of the Wait, Repeat attributes of a zone will enable the feature. 

* *wait* sets the length of time to wait between watering cycles
* *repeat* defines the number of watering cycles to run
